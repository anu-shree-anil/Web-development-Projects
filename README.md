It is a simple Maths Game in which multiplication questions are generated randomly with four options given.
If you choose the correct option then score will be increased by 1 otherwise we can try other options unless we click the correct one.
There is also a timer for 60 seconds, when the timer reaches 0 it will display a message "GAME OVER!" with your score.
